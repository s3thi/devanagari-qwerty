# devanagari-qwerty

This is a port of the Devanagari QWERTY keyboard layout from macOS to Windows. If you have a regular QWERTY keyboard, this layout is much more convenient for typing languages that use Devanagari than the INSCRIPT layout standardized by the Indian government.

## Installation

The easiest way to install this layout is to download and run the installer from the releases page. You should then be able to see the layout in the list of input methods in the Windows settings as well as the language bar.

If you want to customize the layout, you can download the source code and open the project in Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator. You can then modify the layout and use the "Build DLL and Setup Package" option to create a new installer for your custom layout.
