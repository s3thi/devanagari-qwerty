# devanagari-qwerty

This is a port of the Devanagari QWERTY keyboard layout from macOS to Windows. If you have a regular QWERTY keyboard, this layout is much more convenient for typing Devanagari than the standard INSCRIPT layout.

I primarily use this layout for typing Hindi, but it should work equally well for Sanskrit, Marathi, Nepali, and other Devanagari-based languages.

If you find that the layout is missing any letters, you might want to customize it. See the section on customizing the layout below.

## Installing

[Download and run the installer from the releases page](https://github.com/s3thi/devanagari-qwerty/releases/). You should then be able to see the layout in the list of input methods in the Windows settings. The input method will also appear in your language bar.

## Customizing the Layout

Clone this repository and open `DvQWERTY.klc` using [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102134). When you are satisfied with your customizations, use the "Build DLL and Setup Package" option in the app to create a new installer that includes your changes.
